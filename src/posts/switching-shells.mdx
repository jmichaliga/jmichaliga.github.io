## Switching Shells

What to do when you have to switch from a shell. Linux + Dev Life

- Where are your old shell configs. 
  - from .bashrc, .bash_profile / where are they normally stored (thanks brew + friends)
- Backup your old shell configs.
  - it's good to save em all - and put them somewhere for save keeping.
- Learn where your new shell configs are.
  - Likely similar based on your Operating System, but things can change.
- Add new stuff while you're there.
  - This is a thing, may as well make it worth it's while.
